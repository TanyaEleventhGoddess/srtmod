# srtmod
Modify time offsets for subtitle (srt) files
<<<<<<< HEAD

Python routine to add an offset to a .srt file.

It's normal to find a subtitle file that doesn't quite have the right timing for a movie.
This routine allows you to take an existing .srt file and add a time offset.

Written in Python3

Usage:
		python3 srtmod.py -i <inputfile.srt> -o <outputfile.srt> -t <offset>

		the Offset is in the form HH:MM:SS,mmm
